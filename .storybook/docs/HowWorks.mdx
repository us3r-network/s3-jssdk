## How Underglaze works?

**Underglaze** content is stored on a decentralized data network called **Ceramic ComposeDB**. This ensures that the data shared by your users is open and publicly accessible to anyone who wants to access it, regardless of their geographic location, time zone, or device.

By utilizing a decentralized network, Underglaze offers users a variety of benefits, including high levels of security, resilient to censorship, and transparency.

Furthermore, the decentralized nature of the network means that it is not controlled by any single entity, making it more resilient to censorship and manipulation. As such, Underglaze users can rest assured that their content will remain safe and accessible, regardless of any external pressures or threats.
