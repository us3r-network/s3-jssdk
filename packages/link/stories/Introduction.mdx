[@us3r-network/auth-with-rainbowkit](?path=/docs/auth-auth-with-rainbowkit--docs) and [@us3r-network/profile](?path=/docs/components-profile-introduction--docs) are peerDependencies of @us3r-network/link.

## Usage

You need to wrap your application with `Us3rAuthWithRainbowkitProvider`,`ProfileStateProvider` and `LinkStateProvider` first.

<Source code={App} />

`Us3rAuthWithRainbowkitProvider` establishes a session with Ceramic, which is necessary to retrieve information about the currently logged-in user or perform a write operation on the Ceramic node.

`ProfileStateProvider` and `LinkStateProvider` can assist you in managing and synchronizing the state of all link components.
