# LoginButton

The LoginButton component internally triggers the authorization process of [@us3r-network/auth-with-rainbowkit](?path=/docs/auth-auth-with-rainbowkit--docs).

Although LoginButton has no other child components, it can use the children render function to display different content based on the login status. For example, it can render the user's avatar and name when logged in, the text "Login" when not logged in, and the text "Loading" when requesting login. Additionally, UserAvatar and UserName are separate components that have already been encapsulated elsewhere and have custom styles.


## Example
<Canvas />
<p>
  <details>
    <summary>View custom styles</summary>
    <Source code={StyleCode} />
  </details>
</p>


## Props

<Controls />



## Render Props

LoginButton's children can be a function that receives an object as a parameter, which contains the following properties:

<ArgTypes of={RenderProps} />
