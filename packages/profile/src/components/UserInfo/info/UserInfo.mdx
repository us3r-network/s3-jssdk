# UserInfo

UserInfo is used to display basic information about a user. It can show the information of the currently logged-in user or that of other users.

The UserInfo component serves as a context component. It has several sub-components that display typical user information, such as UserInfo.Avatar, UserInfo.Name, and UserInfo.Bio. These are all headless components that can be combined as needed.

>Components can not only combine their child components, but also integrate other components. 
>For example, the UserInfoEditForm is a component that enables users to edit their information. When a user clicks on their user avatar in UserInfo.Avatar, the editing form UserInfoEditForm can be opened to modify the user's information.
